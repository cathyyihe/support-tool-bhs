2020 BHS project introduction

The client wants us to provide a support tool which could convert the provided medical records into specified formats files in order to use it later for analytics.

The main purpose of the scripts is to clean data. Inputs documents varies (CSV is only one of them). Suppose the output is ARFF files(Weka).
Data types might be more specific (num-int/float/complex, str,list,tuple), and output formats might be extended to see5. 

We will modify the orignal repository according to our needs first.

We will have a much better model since the sample data provides. Test will be done as part of the tool assessment report.

All members are required to leave their own footprint on Github website and contribute to this project.

If there is any unproper content or use of the scrips, please feel free to contact with the project manager Yi. GitID: Cathyyihe.
